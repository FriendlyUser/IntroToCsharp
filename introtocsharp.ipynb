    "# Introduction to C#\n",
    "C# is a powerful and widely used programming language that was designed by Microsoft Corporation in the early 2000s. It is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and offers a wide range of features for developing robust and scalable applications. C# is used for building Windows desktop applications, web applications, and mobile applications. The language is a key component of the .NET framework, a software platform that provides a unified environment for developing, deploying, and running applications. In this article, we will explore the history and development of C# and the .NET framework, the basic concepts and features of the C# language, the relationship between C# and the .NET framework, and an overview of the .NET ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The History and Development of C# and the .NET Framework\n",
    "C# is a general-purpose, contemporary, and object-oriented programming language that was developed by Microsoft in 2000 as part of the .NET framework [1]. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003.  Anders Hejlsberg, who was also the lead developer of Turbo Pascal and Borland Delphi. The first version of C# was released in 2000, along with the initial release of the .NET framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of C# and the .NET framework began in the late 1990s. At that time, Microsoft was looking for a way to simplify the development of Windows applications and to make it easier for developers to create software that could run on multiple platforms. The result was the .NET framework, which provided a common runtime environment and a set of libraries for building applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# was designed to be simple and easy to use while still providing powerful features for building complex applications. Some of its key features include strong type checking, garbage collection, and support for object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of C# is its relationship with the .NET framework. C# code is compiled into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL), which can then be executed by the .NET runtime. This allows C# programs to run on any platform that supports the .NET framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .NET ecosystem has grown significantly since its inception and now includes several different implementations. The original implementation, known as the .NET Framework, is still widely used on Windows systems. However, there are also other implementations such as .NET Core and Mono that allow developers to build cross-platform applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, C# is a powerful programming language that was developed as part of Microsoft’s .NET initiative. It provides many useful features for building complex applications while remaining easy to use. Its close relationship with the .NET framework allows developers to build cross-platform software using a common set of tools.\n",
    "Since its initial release, C# has gone through several versions, each adding new features and improving performance [1]. It has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C# language was developed with the primary goal of creating a language that was simple, modern, and easy to use. It was also designed to be a statically-typed language that would offer better performance and type safety than dynamically-typed languages like JavaScript and Python. C# was also designed to be an object-oriented language, with support for classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, C# has evolved and improved with each new version of the language. Microsoft has released multiple versions of C#, with the latest being C# 10.0, which was released in 2021. Each new version of C# has introduced new features and improvements, making the language more powerful and easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basic Concepts and Features of the C# Language\n",
    "C# is an object-oriented language that is based on the C programming language. It offers a wide range of features for developing robust and scalable applications. Some of the key concepts and features of the C# language are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Object-oriented programming: C# is an object-oriented language, which means that it is designed around the concept of objects. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects. C# supports classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces.\n",
    "2. Type safety: C# is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at compile time. This makes the language more efficient and offers better type safety than dynamically-typed languages.\n",
    "3. Garbage collection: C# uses automatic garbage collection to manage memory. This means that the language automatically deallocates memory that is no longer being used, making it easier for developers to write safe and efficient code.\n",
    "4. Exception handling: C# has robust support for exception handling, which allows developers to handle errors and exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "5. LINQ: C# offers Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which is a powerful tool for querying data from different sources like databases, XML files, and collections.\n",
    "6. Delegates: C# supports delegates, which are a type-safe way of passing functions as arguments to other functions.\n",
    ".NET is an umbrella term that includes both .NET Framework and .NET Core. .NET Framework is a Windows-only framework while .NET Core is cross-platform and can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Relationship between C# and the .NET Framework\n",
    "C# is a key component of the .NET framework, which is a software platform that provides a unified environment for developing, deploying, and running applications. The .NET framework consists of a runtime environment, a class library, and a set of development tools. C# is one of the primary programming languages used to develop applications on the .NET framework functionality that makes it easier for developers to build applications. The runtime environment, also known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), provides services such as memory management, security, and exception handling. The class library provides a set of reusable components that developers can use to build applications. The development tools, such as Visual Studio, provide an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to write, debug, and deploy applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# is designed to be compatible with the .NET framework. The language is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) code, which is a platform-agnostic code that can run on any platform that has the .NET runtime installed. This means that C# applications can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems that support the .NET framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Overview of the .NET Ecosystem\n",
    "The .NET ecosystem includes different implementations of the .NET framework, including .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Mono.\n",
    "\n",
    "**.NET Framework**: The .NET Framework is the original implementation of the .NET framework, which was released in 2002. It is designed to run on Windows and includes a large class library and a set of development tools. The .NET Framework is widely used for developing Windows desktop applications, web applications, and server applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**.NET Core**: .NET Core is a cross-platform implementation of the .NET framework that was released in 2016. It is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux and includes a smaller, optimized class library. .NET Core is widely used for developing web applications, microservices, and containerized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mono**: Mono is an open-source implementation of the .NET framework that was released in 2004. It is designed to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. Mono includes a class library that is compatible with the .NET Framework and supports a wide range of programming languages, including C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these implementations, the .NET ecosystem includes a wide range of tools, frameworks, and libraries that make it easier for developers to build applications. Some of the popular tools and frameworks in the .NET ecosystem are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ASP.NET: A web framework for building web applications.\n",
    "2. Entity Framework: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for working with databases.\n",
    "3. Xamarin: A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.\n",
    "4. Blazor: A web framework for building web applications using C# and .NET.\n",

    "# Fundamentals of C#\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of C# is its strong type system. This means that every variable and expression has a specific type that is known at compile-time. This helps to prevent common programming errors and makes it easier to write robust and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# also supports many advanced features such as delegates, events, and LINQ (Language Integrated Query). These features make it easy to write powerful and expressive code that can handle complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to start writing C# programs, you will need to install the .NET Framework on your computer. This provides the runtime environment for executing C# programs. You will also need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a .NET command-line application using the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface). To get started, you’ll need to have the .NET SDK installed on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have that installed, you can open a command prompt and create a new project by running `dotnet new console`. This will create a new console application project for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then add your code to the Program.cs file and test your application by running dotnet run. Once you’re happy with your application, you can package it as a tool so that it can be distributed and used by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have these tools installed, you can start writing your first C# program. A simple \"Hello World\" program in C# might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace HelloWorld\n",
    "{\n",
    "    class Program\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        static void Main(string[] args)\n",

    "Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET.\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It’s free to download and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Polyglot Notebooks extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to use multiple languages in the same notebook and share variables between them. This means that you don’t have to install different Jupyter kernels or use wrapper libraries to work with multiple languages in a single notebook. With this extension, you can get the best language server support for the language of your choice without having to switch between different tools [1].\n",

    "### Java vs C#\n",
    "Java and C# are two popular programming languages that share many similarities, but also have some notable differences. In this section, we'll compare and contrast these two languages in terms of syntax, platform support, performance, and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "Java and C# have similar syntax, as they both use curly braces to define blocks of code and semicolons to separate statements. However, there are some key differences in their syntax, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "C# uses the var keyword to declare implicitly typed variables, whereas Java does not.\n",
    "C# uses properties to encapsulate the state of an object, while Java uses getter and setter methods.\n",
    "C# supports extension methods, which allow you to add new methods to existing classes, whereas Java does not.\n",
    "C# has a built-in using statement that simplifies the use of disposable resources, while Java requires explicit use of try-with-resources or manual cleanup.\n",
    "#### Platform Support\n",
    "Java is known for its platform independence, as it can run on a wide variety of operating systems and hardware architectures. C#, on the other hand, was initially developed by Microsoft for use on Windows platforms, but has since been open-sourced and is now supported on other platforms through .NET Core and Xamarin.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance\n",
    "Both Java and C# are generally considered to be high-performance languages, with similar runtime speeds. However, C# has some advantages in terms of memory management, as it uses a garbage collector that is more efficient and can reduce memory fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Factors\n",
    "There are other factors to consider when comparing Java and C#, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Java has a larger ecosystem and community, with more libraries and tools available.\n",
    "C# has better support for modern language features, such as async/await and LINQ.\n",
    "Java has better support for functional programming, with features such as lambdas and streams.\n",
    "C# has better integration with Windows operating systems and tools, such as Visual Studio.\n",
    "Overall, both Java and C# are powerful and versatile programming languages that are well-suited for a wide range of applications. Choosing between them depends on factors such as platform support, development environment, and the specific needs of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "# Introduction to Linq\n",
    "\n",
    "LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a set of language extensions for the Microsoft .NET Framework that allows developers to perform queries on data sources using a syntax similar to SQL. It supports querying data in a variety of formats, including arrays, lists, databases, and XML documents. LINQ was introduced in the .NET Framework version 3.5 and is available in C# and Visual Basic. LINQ makes it easier to write data access code and provides a consistent way to query and manipulate data, regardless of its source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LINQ queries are composed of a series of operators that can be chained together to filter, transform, and shape data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"From\" operator specifies the data source for the query. This can be an array, list, or any other collection that implements the IEnumerable interface.\n",
    "* The \"Where\" operator is used to filter the data based on a certain condition. It returns only the elements that match the specified condition.\n",
    "* The \"Select\" operator is used to project the data into a new form. It allows you to select only the properties or fields that you are interested in and create a new collection of the results.\n",
    "* The \"OrderBy\" operator is used to sort the data based on a certain property or field. It returns the data in ascending order by default, but can also be used with the \"OrderByDescending\" operator to sort in descending order.\n",

    "### WHat is SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to store, retrieve, and manage data in a database, and it is the standard language used to interact with relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL allows you to create, modify, and delete databases, tables, and records within a database. It provides a set of commands for querying and updating data, as well as for creating and modifying the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL consists of several components, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Definition Language (DDL) commands, which are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, and indexes.\n",
    "Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands, which are used to insert, update, and delete data in a database.\n",
    "Data Query Language (DQL) commands, which are used to retrieve data from a database.\n",
    "Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands, which are used to manage transactions in a database.\n",
    "SQL is a declarative language, meaning that you specify what you want to do with the data, rather than how to do it. This makes it a powerful tool for managing large amounts of data and performing complex operations on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to create a students SQL table, and perform basic INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, and DELETE operations using SQL commands:\n",

    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert new student\n",
    "INSERT INTO students (id, first_name, last_name, age)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 20);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Update student record\n",

    "-- Select all students\n",
    "SELECT * FROM students;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Delete student record\n",
    "DELETE FROM students\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "The CREATE TABLE command is used to create the students table, with columns for id, first_name, last_name, and age. The id column is designated as the primary key for the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The INSERT INTO command is used to add a new student record to the table, with values for id, first_name, last_name, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UPDATE command is used to modify an existing student record in the table, setting the age to 21 for the student with an id of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT command is used to retrieve all records from the students table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DELETE FROM command is used to remove the student record with an id of 1 from the students table.\n",
    "\n",

    "To use LINQ to SQL, you need to create a mapping between the relational database and the object-oriented model. This is done by creating a DataContext class that defines the tables, columns, and relationships in the database. Once the mapping is done you can use LINQ syntax to query the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use LINQ to SQL to query data from a SQL database:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using (var db = new DataContext())\n",
    "{\n",
    " var query = from customer in db.Customers\n",
    " where customer.Country == \"USA\"\n",
    " select customer;\n",
    "\n",
    " foreach (var customer in query)\n",
    " {\n",
    " Console.WriteLine(customer.FirstName + \" \" + customer.LastName);\n",
    " }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the \"From\" operator specifies the data source is the Customers table, the \"Where\" operator filters the data to only include customers from the USA, and \"Select\" operator selects the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the method syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using (var db = new DataContext())\n",
    "{\n",
    " var query = db.Customers.Where(c => c.Country == \"USA\")\n",
    " .Select(c => new {c.FirstName, c.LastName});\n",
    "\n",
    " foreach (var customer in query)\n",
    " {\n",
    " Console.WriteLine(customer.FirstName + \" \" + customer.LastName);\n",
    " }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query will give you the same result as the previous one, but this is the method syntax of LINQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use other operators like OrderBy, OrderByDescending, Take, Skip, etc. to shape your data and make it more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With entities Framework it's similar, but you'll use the \"DbContext\" class instead of the \"DataContext\" and you'll need to create a model of the database using EF Core or EF 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that LINQ queries against a SQL database are executed when the query is enumerated, such as by using a foreach loop to iterate through the results, or by calling the `ToList()`, `ToArray()` or `Count()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember that it is a good practice to use the `using` statement to dispose of the DataContext/DbContext and the opened connection to avoid any memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LINQ provides a number of advanced operators that can be used to perform more complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"GroupBy\" operator is used to group elements in a collection based on a certain key. It returns a collection of groups, where each group contains a key and a collection of elements that share that key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "`var query = from student in students\n",
    " group student by student.Department into g\n",
    " select new {Department = g.Key, Students = g};`\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query groups the students by their department, and returns a collection of groups where each group contains the department name and a collection of students that belong to that department.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"Join\" operator is used to join two collections based on a common key. It returns a collection of elements that have matching keys in both collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var query = from student in students\n",
    " join department in departments on student.Department equals department.DepartmentName\n",
    " select new {student.FirstName, student.LastName, department.DepartmentName};\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query joins the students and departments collections by the department name, and returns a collection of elements that contains the student's first name, last name, and department name.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"Aggregate\" operator is used to apply a function to the elements of a collection and return a single value. It can be used to perform calculations such as sum, average, or count.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "var query = students.Where(s => s.Department == \"Computer Science\")\n",
    " .Select(s => s.Grade)\n",
    " .Average();\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query filters the students collection to only include students from the Computer Science department, selects their grades, and calculates the average grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these operators can be combined with other LINQ operators, like \"Where\", \"Select\", \"OrderBy\" etc. to create more complex and powerful queries. Also, these operators are executed after the query is enumerated, such as by using a foreach loop to iterate through the results, or by calling the `ToList()`, `ToArray()` or `Count()` methods."

    "### Linq for Web Scrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful tool in C# that enables developers to query data from various data sources using a consistent syntax. In web scraping, LINQ can be used to extract data from HTML and XML documents in a concise and readable manner. Here are some advanced uses of LINQ for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transformation: LINQ can be used to transform scraped data into a desired format. For example, you can use LINQ to extract only the text content from HTML or XML documents, or to extract only specific data points from a larger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data filtering: LINQ can be used to filter out unwanted data points during the scraping process. For example, you can use LINQ to exclude data that is not relevant to your analysis or to remove duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data aggregation: LINQ can be used to aggregate scraped data into meaningful summaries. For example, you can use LINQ to group data by category or to calculate averages, counts, or other statistical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation: LINQ can be used to validate scraped data to ensure that it meets certain criteria. For example, you can use LINQ to check that data points are of a certain type or within a certain range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integration: LINQ can be used to integrate scraped data with other data sources. For example, you can use LINQ to merge scraped data with data from a database or to combine multiple datasets into a single dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. It can be done manually by a user or automatically by a program. In this post, we'll explore how to perform web scraping using C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's understand the basics of web scraping. When we visit a website, our web browser sends a request to the server hosting the website. The server responds with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the website. Our web browser then renders the website based on these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping works in a similar way. Instead of a web browser, we use a program to send a request to the server and receive the response. We can then parse the HTML to extract the data we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C#, we can use the `HttpClient` class to send HTTP requests and receive responses. Here's an example of how to send a GET request to a website and receive the response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using System.Net.Http;\n",
    "using System.Threading.Tasks;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace WebScrapingExample\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static async Task<string> GetWebsiteContentAsync(string url)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        using (var client = new HttpClient())\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var response = await client.GetAsync(url);\n",
    "            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\n",
    "            return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create an instance of the HttpClient class and use its GetAsync method to send a GET request to the specified URL. We then use the EnsureSuccessStatusCode method to ensure that the response was successful. Finally, we use the ReadAsStringAsync method to read the response content as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the HTML content of the website, we can use an HTML parser to extract the data we need. There are several HTML parsers available for C#, such as HtmlAgilityPack and AngleSharp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of how to use HtmlAgilityPack to extract the titles of the articles on the front page of a news website:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "using HtmlAgilityPack;\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace WebScrapingExample\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public static List<string> GetArticleTitles(string html)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        var doc = new HtmlDocument();\n",
    "        doc.LoadHtml(html);\n",
    "\n",
    "        var titles = new List<string>();\n",
    "        foreach (var node in doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(\"//h2[@class='title']/a\"))\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            titles.Add(node.InnerText);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        return titles;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create an instance of the HtmlDocument class and use its LoadHtml method to load the HTML content. We then use the SelectNodes method to select the nodes that match the specified XPath expression. In this case, we’re selecting all a elements that are children of h2 elements with a class attribute of title. We then use the InnerText property to get the text content of each node and add it to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the basics of web scraping in C#! Of course, there’s a lot more to it, such as handling pagination, dealing with AJAX content, and respecting the website’s terms of service and robots.txt file. But this should give you a good starting point for your own web scraping projects.\n"

    "## Ranking software Engineers\n",
    "To rank software engineers, companies use a variety of metrics to assess their performance, including code quality, productivity, and collaboration with team members. In this blog post, we will explore how companies can use scripts to automate the ranking process and save time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you ready to proceed? This following section will cover how to rank engineers by git commits using bash, we will visualize the results using C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring software engineers' performance by the lines of code written and number of commits is a common practice in many companies, especially those with large engineering teams. Here are some reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantifiable metric:** Lines of code and number of commits are easy to measure and quantify. It provides a tangible metric to assess a developer's output and contribution to the codebase.\n",
    "2. **Objective assessment:** By measuring objective metrics like lines of code and commits, companies can assess an engineer's performance without any biases or subjectivity. It eliminates the possibility of personal preference or favoritism influencing the assessment.\n",
    "3. **Consistency across teams:** Measuring lines of code and commits is consistent across all teams, regardless of the project or programming language being used. It allows for comparison between different teams and engineers, making it easier to identify areas of strength and weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that using lines of code and commits alone does not provide a complete picture of an engineer's performance. Other factors like code quality, bug fixing, and collaboration with team members should also be taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```go \n",

    "# Change to the directory of the Git repository\n",
    "cd /path/to/repository\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get a list of all authors in the repository\n",
    "AUTHORS=$(git log --format='%ae' | sort -u)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the list of file extensions to search for\n",
    "EXTENSIONS=(\"html\" \"scss\" \"tsx\" \"ts\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop through the authors and file extensions and search for changes\n",
    "for author in $AUTHORS; do\n",
    "    for extension in \"${EXTENSIONS[@]}\"; do\n",
    "        echo \"Changes made by $author to .$extension files:\"\n",
    "        git log --author=\"$author\" --oneline --name-only --pretty=format: | grep \"\\.$extension$\" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 10\n",
    "    done\n",
    "done \n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Bash script that can be used to search for changes made by each author to specific file extensions in a Git repository. Later we will run this script in a polygot notebook, I named this script `changes_by_file.sh`. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The script changes the current working directory to the location of the Git repository.\n",
    "2. The `git log` command is used to get a list of all authors in the repository, and the `sort` command is used to remove duplicates and sort the list alphabetically.\n",
    "3. An array of file extensions to search for is defined using the `EXTENSIONS` variable.\n",
    "4. Two nested `for` loops are used to loop through each author and file extension. For each combination of author and extension, the script runs the `git log` command again, this time with the `--author` option to filter by the current author and the `--name-only` option to only show the names of the files that were changed.\n",
    "5. The output of the `git log` command is piped to the `grep` command to filter only files with the current extension. The output is then piped to the `sort` and `uniq` commands to count the number of changes made to each file and remove duplicates.\n",
    "6. The output is then sorted by the number of changes in descending order using the `sort -rn` command and the top 10 files with the most changes are displayed using the `head -n 10` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script can be used to quickly assess each author's contributions to specific file types in a Git repository.\n",

The `-s` option tells Git to only show the number of commits for each author, and the `-n` option tells Git to sort the authors by the number of commits in descending order. The `--all` option tells Git to include all branches in the count.\n",
    "3. The output of the `git shortlog` command is piped to a `while` loop that reads the count and author fields from each line of output. The loop then echoes the author and count fields separated by a colon.\n",
